# ViterbiDecoderFor802.11
This is a part of our cuda sdr project, written in pure c++ without any other dependencies, which can be easily changed to cuda implementation. 
This decoder can not be used as a generic viterbi decoder. 
It is based on 802.11 standard. 
But hopefully, we will present some basic views of the viterbi algorithm in the following sections, which may give you an idea to implement your own decoder.

***Notes: since we only tested this code using a limited bunch of input, there might be unforeseen bugs in some cases.***
